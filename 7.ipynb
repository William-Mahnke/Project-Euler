    "To find prime numbers, we can first start with a list of some of the prime numbers we know. If a number isn't prime, it will be divisible by one of the prime numbers. Thus we can iterate through the list of prime numbers up to the square root of the number we're testing. If none evenly divide the number, then it's a prime we can add to our list. We can use a loop to check the length of the list every new iteration, only stopping when the list has a length of 10001 in which case we return the last element."

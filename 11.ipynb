    "## Largest Product in Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the following 20x20 grid?\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: didn't display the grid here because of difficulty in formatting the grid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this problem can be done iterating through the entries in the grid. Since going up and down or left and right can produce the same result (e.g. doing the product of four numbers in the downward direction would be the same result as the product of the four numbers in the up direction starting at the lower point), we can save time by starting at the top and working our way down (going right, down, diagonally left, and diagonally right). The only other thing to be wary of is the indexing, making sure to not go outside the index of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ease the transformation of the grid of numbers into a matrix I can use, I'll create a numpy array. It's also perfectly viable to use nested lists with the same approach, I just used numpy to make indexing easier."

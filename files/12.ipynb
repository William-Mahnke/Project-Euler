    "## Highly Divisible Triangular Number\n",

    "The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding up the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would $1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28$. The first ten terms would be: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...\n",

    "Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3: 1, 3\n",
    "\n",
    "6: 1, 2, 3, 6\n",
    "\n",
    "10: 1, 2, 5, 10\n",
    "\n",
    "15: 1, 3, 5, 15\n",

    "21: 1, 3, 7, 21\n",
    "\n",
    "28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors (not including the number itself). What is the value of the first triangle number to have over 500 divisors? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating each following triangle will be easy, we can use the formula $\\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$. To check the divisors, we can iterate through the natural numbers up to the square root of the number to check for factors. When adding the factors to the list, we'll also want to calculate the quotient so we can store both of the values. Iterating up to the square root ensures we don't duplicate factor pairs."

    "\n",
    "One can easily verify that squaring the primes less than 13 doesn't yield any reversible prime squares. Thus we can start checking prime squares with 17. For each square, we have to check if it meets the established criteria. If it doesn't we can add the square and the reverse to the list (since the reverse of the square will also meet the criteria). Additionally, when checking if the square root of the reverse is prime, we can add the primes (the square roots for the reversible numbers) to a different list. This way we can avoid some evaluations and the potenital to have duplicate entries in our list. "

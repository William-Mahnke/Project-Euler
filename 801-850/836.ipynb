    "Let A be an **affine plane** over a **radically integral local field** F with residual characteristic p. \n",

    "We consider an **open oriented line section** U of A with normalized Haar measure m. \n",
    "\n",
    "Define f(m,p) as the maximal possible discriminant of the **jacobian** associated to the **orthogonal kernel embedding** of U into A.\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem is a joke. If you take the first letter in each bolded word in the problem you get the answer, aprilfoolsjoke."

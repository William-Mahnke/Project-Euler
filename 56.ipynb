    "A googol ($10^100$) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the difits in each number is only 1.\n",

    "Using a nested for loop (which does have $O(n^2)$ complexity), we can iterate through the combinations. For each iteration we will have to convert the integer into a string then into a list of charaters and then calculate the digit sum."

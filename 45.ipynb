    "Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:\n",
    "\n",
    "Triangle - $T_n = n(n+1)/2 \\rightarrow 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \\dots$\n",
    "\n",
    "Pentagonal - $P_n = n(3n-1)/2 \\rightarrow 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \\dots$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hexagonal - $H_n = n(2n-1) \\rightarrow 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \\dots$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be verified $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$. Find the next triangle number which is also pentagonal and hexagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple (yet slow) way to solve this problem would be calculating the nth term for each sequence. Since the triangle number sequence grows slower than the other sequences by design, for each iteration we could simply check whether a triangle number is found in the other lists as we concurrently generate them. Additionally, since the problem states one qualifying number is 40755 which starts in the hexagonal sequence at index 143, we can start the lists at the corresponding indices."

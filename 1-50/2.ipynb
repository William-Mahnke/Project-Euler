    "Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\n",

    "Using a loop, we can create a list of the fibonacci numbers under four million. However, rather than creating a list, we can keep track of the running total while only keeping the previous two numbers. Additionally, given the nature of the sequence (adding consecutive numbers), we can see that every third number after 2 is going to be even."

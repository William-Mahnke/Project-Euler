    "Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:\n",

    "$1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4$\n",

    "The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "First we can create a list mapping digits to their fifth power to save an exponent evaluation for each digit. Using this, we can iterate through numbers (starting after 1) and add any numbers to the total if they meet the criterion. "

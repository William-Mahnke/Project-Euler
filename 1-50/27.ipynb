    "## Quadratic Primes\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: $n^2+n+41$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \\leq n \\neq 39$. However, when $n = 40$, $40^2 + 40 + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produced 80 primes from consecutive values $0 \\leq n \\leq 79$. The product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider quadratics of the form: $n^2 + an + b, \\text{ where } |a| < 1000 \\text{ and } |b| \\leq 1000$ where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression which produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with $n=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface it appears we have about 4 million different combinations of a and b to try. However, we can narrow our search down considerably. Since we start at n = 0 every time, that means b has to be a prime number. We go further and narrow down the options for a. If b is a prime number which almost always means it's odd, then when n = 1 is plugged into the quadratic you get 1 + a prime (odd) number + a. If a is even then you would have an odd number plus an odd number plus an even number which results in an even number. Thus if we limit the scope of a to just odd numbers we cut the number of options to look at in half for each prime number choice in b. The only cases we might be weary of are $b = 2$ where we actually would want a to be an even number. However, if the modulus of b is equal to 2 and a is an even number then plugging in $n = 2$ will lead to an even number. Therefore we can ignore $b = 2$ entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the number of choices cut down, we can iterate through the remaining possibilites, keeping track of the longest chain and the product of coefficients associated with that longest chain. Since the focus of the question is less about finding prime numbers, I will use a package to let me check if a number is prime right away."

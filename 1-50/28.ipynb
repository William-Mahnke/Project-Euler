    "## Number Spiral Diagonals\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows (shown in a matrix to preserve spiral structure):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "21 & 22 & 23 & 24 & 25 \\\\ \n",
    "20 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10  \\\\ \n",
    "19 & 6 & 1 & 2 & 11 \\\\ \n",

    "It can be verified the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming won't be needed for this problem until we get the final summation. If we continue writing the spiral for a few more iterations we can see four different sequences emerge for the four different diagonals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to the right (1): 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Down to the right (2): 1, 3, 13, 31, 57, 91, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Down to the left (3): 1, 5, 17, 37, 65, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to the left (4): 1, 7, 21, 43, 73, 111, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "For sequence (1), it's easy to see the number are the squares of the odd numbers. Additionally for sequence (3), we can see the sequence is made up of adding 1 to the square of the even integers. For sequences (2) and (4), there isn't quite such a clear pattern. It's possible to develop a formula adding different values to the square of numbers, but this will be messy. Alternatively we can observe that the difference between a term and the one before it increases by 8 every iteration. This is true for all of the sequences. If you look at the shape of the spiral, we can see every additional layer to the spiral has eight more numbers than the previous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this knowedlge, we can create four lists for the four different sequences before adding them up for the final total. To avoid overlap we'll include 1 in just sequence 1. Since the spiral will include $1001 \\times 1001 = 1002001$ numbers, we'll iterate the lists up to this value."

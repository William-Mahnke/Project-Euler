    "## Pandigital Primes\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall say that an 𝑛-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to 𝑛 exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a function to check whether a number is pandigital or not is rather simple. Since we're looking for a pandigital prime, we can start at 1 billion and work backwards. However, attempting this method will take too long. To narrow down our search we can rule out groups of numbers. Since the pandigital numbers all have the same digit sum (for a specific size), we can first look at the digit sums for numbers of size n:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 : 1, 2 : 3, 3 : 6, 4 : 10, 5 : 15, 6 : 21, 7 : 28, 8 : 36, 9 : 45\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see any pandigital numbers of size 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 aren't going to be prime because their digit sum is divisible by 3 (and thus also divisible by three). To narrow our search we can start with the seven digit numbers. If the loop is too long, we can then move down to the four digit numbers.  "

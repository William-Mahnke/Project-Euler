    "## Sub-string Divisibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $d_1$ be the 1st digit, $d_2$ be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $d_2d_3d_4 = 406$ is divisible by 2\n",
    "* $d_3d_4d_5 = 063$ is divisible by 3\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: for this problem we can assume the first digit won't be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be done without any code. Looking at the third property, we can see that if $d_4d_5d_6$ must be divisible by 5 then $d_6$ will either be 0 or 5. This means if $d_6d_7d_8$ must be divisible by 11 then those three digits must be a number divisible by 11 which also starts with a 0 or a 5. For the case when the first digit is 0 (i.e. two-digit multiples of 11), all of these multiples repeat digits. Since the number is pandigital, we can eliminate the possibility of $d_6 = 0$ and proceed with the multiples of 11 in the 500s. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three-digit multiples of 11 which start with a 5 are as follows: 506, 517, 528, 539, 550, 561, 572, 583, 594. We can first remove 550 because it repeats digits. Then for the remaining possibilities we can fill in digits to see if there are possible pandigital numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "506 $\\rightarrow$ _ _ _ _ _ 5 0 6 _ _: If $d_6 = 5, d_7 = 0, d_8 = 0$ then $d_9$ would have to be 5 (065 is the only multiple of 13 which works). Since this digit is already used, we can conclude this choice of digits for spots 6, 7, and 8 won't work. \n",
    "\n",
    "517 $\\rightarrow$ _ _ _ _ _ 5 1 7 _ _: In this case there is no value for $d_9$ which will satisfy the requirement for $d_7d_8d_9$ (no three-digit multiple of 13 starts with 17). Thus this choice won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "528 $\\rightarrow$ _ _ _ _ _ 5 2 8 _ _: This choice of digits forces $d_9$ to be 6 and consequently forces $d_{10}$ to be 7. Working backwards and starting with filling $d_5$, the two three-digit multiples of 7 which end with 52 are 252 and 952. Since 252 uses a digit twice, the only possibility is $d_5 = 9$. At this point the number has the form _ _ _ _ 9 5 2 8 6 7. Of the remaining digits (0, 1, 3, and 4), the fact $d_3d_4d_5$ must be divisible by 3 forces $d_3$ and $d_4$ to be 0 and 3. Additionally, since $d_2d_3d_4$ is divisible by 2, we are forced to set $d_3 = 3, d_4 = 0$. With these choices we can interchange 1 and 4 in the first two digits which leads us to two pandigital numbers which satisfies the property: 1430952867, 4130952867.\n",
    "\n",
    "539 $\\rightarrow$ _ _ _ _ _ 5 3 9 _ _: In this case $d_9 = 0$ which means $d_{10} = 1$. Then $d_5 = 5$, but that digit is already being used so this choice won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "561 $\\rightarrow$ _ _ _ _ _ 5 6 1 _ _: The only digit for $d_9$ which works is 1. Since that digit is already being used, this case won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "572 $\\rightarrow$ _ _ _ _ _ 5 7 2 _ _: In this case we get $d_9 = 8$ which implies $d_{10} = 9$ which prompts $d_5 = 3$. Thus any candidate number is of the form _ _ _ _ 3 5 7 2 8 9. Of the remaining digits (0, 1, 4, 6) the property thus requires $d_3$ and $d_4$ to be 0 and 6. Since they're both even they can be placed interchangably and the remaining two digits can also be switched. Thus with this case we get four different candidates: 1406357289, 4106257289, 1460357289, and 4160357289.\n",
    "\n",
    "583 $\\rightarrow$ _ _ _ _ _ 5 8 3 _ _: In this case $d_9 = 2$ and $d_{10} = 3$. Since 3 is already being used, this case won't work. \n",
    "\n",
    "594 $\\rightarrow$ _ _ _ _ _ 5 9 4 _ _: In this case $d_9$ has to be 9 which means this case won't work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if we add up the six numbers which satisfy the property we get the final solution of 16695334890."

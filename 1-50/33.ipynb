    "## Digit Cancelling Fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall consider fractions like 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a function to find these fractions which (1) have a common digit and (2) equal the same when the digit is cancelled out. Since the problem says these fractions must have two digits in both the numerator and the denominator (and they're less than one), we can iterate through the combinations up to the denominator being 99 and the numerator going up to one less than the denominator. \n",
    "\n",
    "When checking fractions using the function, the only time trivial examples will show up are when the common digit is 0. In that case we just return False for the function. Since we're only handling two digit numbers, we don't have to worry about a zero being a leading digit or in another spot to cause problems."

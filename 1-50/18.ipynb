    "NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than trying to calculate the sum of each path, we can use a different trick (like the problem mentions) to speed up the process and eventually scale to the harder version of this problem. Starting at the bottom two rows of the pyramid, we can calculate the sum of the different paths by adding a number in the second to last row with both of its possible options in the last row. If we only keep the larger of the two sums, we can replace the last two rows with this new row which represents the value of the maximum path using those last two rows. If we repeat this process, working up the pyramid, the final list (of one number) will be the maximum value a path can take down the pyramid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Saving the pyramid as a list of lists, we can create a function to calculate the paths given the last two rows of the pyramid and iterate through the indices of the list backwards to get the result. "

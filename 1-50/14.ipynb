    "## Problem 14: Longest Collatz Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "The Collatz Conjecture: Start with a (positive) whole number. Then use the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number is even, divide by two (n -> n/2)\n",
    "* If the number is odd, multiply the number by three and add one (n -> 3n+1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The conjecture says that all positive whole numbers will go down to 1 (and then continue forever in the sequence 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1). For this problem, we're finding the longest chain (most number of steps to 1) it takes for a number less than a million.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "While finding the length of the sequence for each number is feasible, it would take a lot of time. To reduce that time, we'll store the result for each number (the length of the sequence) in a dictionary. When performing the operations, we'll first check if the result is stored in the dictionary. If so, we can take the current length of the sequence and add the value stored in the dictionary (because the sequence will remain consistent)."

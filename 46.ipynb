    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a while loop, we can iterate through the odd numbers (making sure they're composite) and check if this property is true for the number. Since we're looking a sum, we first have to check if the difference of the number and prime divided by two is a square number. Starting with the largest prime number smaller than the composite number and iterating through the primes (down to 3 since 2 won't make it work), if the property never holds then we can conclude the number meets the criteria we're looking for. To speed up the process, we'll use the math package (specifically the sqrt function) and the sympy package to get primes."

    "## Square Digit Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$44 \\rightarrow 32 \\rightarrow 13 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$85 \\rightarrow 89 \\rightarrow 145 \\rightarrow 42 \\rightarrow 20 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 16 \\rightarrow 37 \\rightarrow 58 \\rightarrow 89$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is the most amazing is EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We first start with creating a reference dictionary where the keys are the starting number and the values are 1 or 89 depending on where the chain ends up looping forever. We can then create a function to perform the square digit chain calculations. For the first few numbers the chain will have to be calculated in its entirety (until it gets to 1 or 89). However, to speed up the process for later numbers so we're not just calculating the chain each time, which will add up over ten million different inputs, we can have the function constantly check if the current iteration of the chain is already in the reference dictionary (if we reach a number we've already calcualted the chain for, we know this chain will end up in the same spot). To further speed up the process, we can store the values of the chain in a list and then add the result for each chain element to the reference dictionary too. With this, we can iterate through the numbers and tally whenever a number reached 89."

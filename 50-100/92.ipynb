    "## Square Digit Chain (WIP)\n",
    "\n",
    "A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$44 \\rightarrow 32 \\rightarrow 13 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$85 \\rightarrow 89 \\rightarrow 145 \\rightarrow 42 \\rightarrow 20 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 16 \\rightarrow 37 \\rightarrow 58 \\rightarrow 89$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is the most amazing is EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a function to go through the chain will be relatively easy, converting the number to a string before adding the square of each character. To save time, we can create a dictionary. Much like the Collatz conjecture, if a number in the chain has already been worked through, we can add it to the dictionary. If we're going through a new chain and arrive back to that number, we can check the result for that number rather than calculating the chain again. "

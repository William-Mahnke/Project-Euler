    "The number 512 is interesting because it's equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and $8^3 = 512$. Another example of a number with this property is $614656 = 28^4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We shall define $a_n$ to be the nth term of this sequence and insist a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.\n",

    "You're given $a_2 = 512$ and $a_{10} = 614656$. Find $a_{30}$. \n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical brute force method would be checking if the criterion is met for each number and continuing until we finally reach the 30th term in the sequence. However, this method proves to take forever. Instead we can flip the approach of the problem. For a number with n digits, the maximum the digit sum can be is $9 \\times n$. While we don't know how many digits the final answer will be, exponents of 9 quickly get large with the exponent values not being super high. Thus instead of checking for each individual number, we can calculate different combinations of bases (representing digit sums) to relatively low powers (nothing more than 15). If the digit sum of the resulting value is equal to the base we're testing, we can add the value to a list and repeat the process until we get enough numbers in the list. If we iterate through all of the combinations and our list still doesn't contain 30 elements, we can raise the limit of the exponent and try again. (Additionally the nature of these exponents means the numbers won't always be stored in order, so so sorting the list is necessary to getting the 30th term in the sequence). "

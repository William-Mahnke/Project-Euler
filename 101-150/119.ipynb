    "The number 512 is interesting because it's equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and $8^3 = 512$. Another example of a number with this property is $614656 = 28^4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We shall define $a_n$ to be the nth term of this sequence and insist a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.\n",

    "You're given $a_2 = 512$ and $a_{10} = 614656$. Find $a_{30}$. \n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up the process of checking numbers we can use math's log function. Thus once we sum the digits in the string version of the number, we can check if the log (base sum of digits) is a whole number. We can continue this process until we get up to $a_{30}$."

    "Using names.txt (found in files), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of $938 \\times 53 = 49714$. \n",

    "\n",
    "The names.txt file already has the names split by a comma. Thus we can load the names into a list, and then sort the list to get the names in alphabetical order. Then, iterating through the list, we can calculate the name score before multiplying the result by the position the name is in the sorted list."
